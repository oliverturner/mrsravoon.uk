# Alternative Endings <span>to an</span> Unwritten Ballad

In 1965 Paul Dehn published _The Fern on the Rock_ and introduced the world to
Mrs. Ravoon. Ever snce this d√©but, contributors queuing to catalogue her
remarkable adventures have been as moths to the flame.

We strongly encourage you to [singe your wings](/report): this site aims to be a
durable new home for our deathless heroine and a repository for reports of
[further sightings](/sightings).
