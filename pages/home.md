# Alternative Endings <span>to an</span> Unwritten Ballad

In 1965 Paul Dehn published _The Fern on the Rock_ and introduced the world to
Mrs. Ravoon. Since then she has taken on a life of her own, inspiring numerous
contributors to the corpus of work cataloguing her remarkable adventures and
celebrating her unforgettable name.

Since the unfortunate demise of [the original](http://mrsravoon.com/), this site is a new home for our deathless heroine and a repository for her
continued sightings.
