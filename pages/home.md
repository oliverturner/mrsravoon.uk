# Alternative Endings <span class="block">to an</span> Unwritten Ballad

In 1965 Paul Dehn published *The Fern on the Rock* and introduced the world to Mrs. Ravoon. Ever since this d√©but, contributors queuing to catalogue her remarkable adventures have been as moths to the flame.

We strongly encourage you to [singe your wings](/report): this site aims to be a durable new home for our deathless heroine and a repository for reports of [further sightings](/sightings).
