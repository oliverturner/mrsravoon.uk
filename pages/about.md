For many, I imagine, an acquaintance with MRS RAVOON will have been via John Julius Norwich in one of his wonderful [_Christmas Crackers_](https://johnsandoe.com/product/the-ultimate-christmas-cracker/). In it, he credits fellow commonplace compiler [Linda Kelly](https://oldsite.johnsandoe.com/product/consolations-a-commonplace-book/) with the discovery before introducing the author, the peculiarly obscure Paul Dehn.

I say "peculiarly obscure", because considering the breadth of his accomplishments – Oscar-winning screenwriter, critic, librettist, soldier, spy and, of course, poet – it feels as though he ought to be far better known. Maybe the list was simply overwhelming: perhaps if all he had written was some of the most famous dialogue in film history he would be a household name.

> “Do you expect me to talk?”
> “No, Mr Bond. I expect you to die.”

For an idea of Dehn's poetic range, contrast the poem of his Philip Larkin selected for inclusion in [_The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse_](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780198121374?gC=5a105e8b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt5fflOm96gIVVOvtCh11Pgs8EAQYASABEgI26_D_BwE)

> ### Armistice
> It is finished. The enormous dust-cloud over Europe 
> Lifts like a million swallows; and a light,
> Drifting in craters, touches the quiet dead.

> Now, at the bugle’s hour, before the blood 
> Cakes in a clean wind on their marble faces, 
> Making them monuments; before the sun,

> Hung like a medal on the smoky noon,
> Whitens the bone that feeds the earth; before 
> Wheat-ear springs green again, in the green spring

> And they are bread in the bodies of the young:
> Be strong to remember how the bread died, screaming; 
> Gangrene was corn, and monuments went mad.

with this, from his 1961 Edward-Gorey illustrated anthology _Quake, Quake, Quake_ (which, as the subtitle "A Leaden Treasury of English Verse" portends, is a light-hearted rumination on impending nuclear extinction)

> ### A Game of Consequences
> Coffee-cups cool on the Vicar’s harmonium,
> Clever guests giggle and duffers despond. 
> Soft as the patter of mouse-feet, the whisper 
> Of Eversharp Pencil on Basildon Bond.

> Separate hands scribble separate phrases – 
> Innocent, each, as the new-driven snow.
> What will they spell, when the paper’s unfolded? 
> Lucifer, only, and Belial know.

> ‘Ready, Miss Montague? Come, Mr Jellaby!’ 
> (Peek at your papers and finger your chins) 
> ‘Shy, Mr. Pomfret? You’d rather the Vicar...? 
> Oh, good for the Vicar!’ The Vicar begins:

> ‘FAT MR. POMFRET met FROWSTY MISS MONTAGUE 
> Under the BACK SEAT IN JELLABY’S CART.
> He said to her: WILL YOU DO WHAT I WANT TO YOU? 
> She said to him: THERE’S A SONG IN MY HEART.’

> What was the Consequence? What did the World say? 
> Hist, in the silence, to Damocles’ sword!
> Today Mr Pomfret has left for Karachi
> And little Miss Montague screams in her ward.

Where the first allows its horror to unfurl with an elegiac cadence, in the second we canter dactylically towards its ghastly conclusion with the energy and brio reprised in MRS RAVOON.
