A torch flickered, deep in the Valley of Kings,
"I see", whispered Carter, "oh, wonderful things!"
"Do you think," gasped Carnarvon, "It's Tutankhamun?"
Then it sat up and leered: it was... MRS RAVOON.

Below the salt Channel they're drinking champagne
And ministers jostle to board the first train.
Emergency bells ring in French and Walloon,
For the on the buffers squats... MRS RAVOON.
