I plunged my hand deep in the scummy green water\
Where toads floated fatly, foaming like porter\
Much flotsam and jetsam and what looked like prune\
Be-littered the surface near MRS RAVOON

\
I spied a faint light from the wreck of a shack\
Whence I hastened at speed without looking back\
Alas and alack 'twas not the place to have flewn\
For there, cleaver in hand, stood MRS RAVOON\
\
I squelched through the abattoir's floorful of gristle\
Gobbets of flesh gleamed from the broom's bristle\
Afar in the corner from a marble spittoon\
Leered the blood-spattered features of MRS RAVOON
