Curiously, many Americans imagine {{ macros.ravoon() }} to have originated in traditional song: in the sleevenotes of his 1976 album _Across The Blue Mountains_ the folk singer Harry Tuft reminisced

> Tom Mastin came to the Green Spider, a coffee house in existence in Denver from the late '50's through the mid-'60's, I guess it was in 1962 or '63. From him I taped two songs made from poems: "Calico Pie" by Edward Lear and "{{ macros.ravoon() }}" which Tom said is an old English rhyme.

It must therefore have been Mastin who appended, besides a chorus, the apocryphal penultimate verse:

> I went to an amateur butcher I know
> For the gut of a cat for my violin bow,
> But I never imagined I'd pay my next tune
> On the shuddering entrails of {{ macros.ravoon() }}.

Tuft's version exists in digital form only as a brief fragment:

Happily erstwhile sea captain Kendall Morse covered Tuft's interpretation verbatim, and can be heard as a complete rendition:
