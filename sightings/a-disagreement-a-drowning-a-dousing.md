Over bourbons the Bishop disagreed with the verger,
On matters parochial he continued to urge her, 
Until drained of all grace he took a teaspoon:
Plunged it straight through the heart of MRS RAVOON.

To the briny basalt reaching up from the sea
My shipwrecked soul clutched, desperately.
But damnation awaited, for from it, rough-hewn,
Was a towering effigy: MRS RAVOON

On tropical railways, I toured and explored
When great winds leapt up, and trapped us aboard 
And thus my cruel fate, forced by the monsoon:
To be stuck in a carriage with MRS RAVOON.
