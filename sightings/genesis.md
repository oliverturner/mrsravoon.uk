I stole through the dungeons, while everyone slept, 
Till I came to the cage where the Monster was kept.
There, locked in the arms of a Giant Baboon, 
Rigid and smiling, lay... MRS RAVOON!

I climbed the clock-tower in the first morning sun
And â€˜twas midday at least ere my journey was done;
But the clock never sounded the last stroke of noon,
For there, from the clapper, swung MRS RAVOON.

I ran through the marsh 'midst the lightning and thunder,
When a terrible flash spit the darkness asunder.
Chewing a rat's tail and mumbling a rune,
Mad in the moat, squatted MRS RAVOON.

I stood by the waters so green and so thick,
And I stirred at the scum with my old, withered stick;
When there rose through the ooze, like a monstrous balloon, 
The bloated cadaver of MRS RAVOON.

I hauled in the line, and I took my first look
At the half-eaten horror that hung from the hook.
I had dragged from the depths of the limpid lagoon
The luminous body of MRS RAVOON.

Facing the fens, I looked back from the shore
Where all had been empty a moment before;
And there, by the light of the Lincolnshire moon,
Immense on the marshes, stood... MRS RAVOON!

## Possibly apocryphal...

I went to an amateur butcher I know
For the gut of a cat for my violin bow,
But I never imagined I'd play my next tune
On the shuddering entrails of MRS RAVOON.
